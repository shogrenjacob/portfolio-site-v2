                        <h2>My Roots</h2>
                        <p>My name is Jacob Shogren and I'm a computer science major at Youngstown State University. I've spent my life to this point living in Youngstown, Ohio with my 
                            brother Andrew and parents Aimee and Aaron. I'm the oldest between me and my brother and the oldest of 9 cousins who all also live near Youngstown. I first became
                            interested in technology in middle school where we played online games that taught us how to code. This continued into high school where I took AP Computer Science
                            my junior year at Ursuline High School, which confirmed my love for technology and coding.

                        <h2>Music</h2>
                        <p>In my sophmore year of high school, much to the dismay of my parents' eardrums, I decided to learn to play the drums. Now, I never played in the school band,
                            but a couple friends of mine got together to jam every weekend. We wanted to turn this into a full on band but Covid hit my Junior year of high school and derailed
                            that idea pretty hard. Now that we've all gone off to seperate colleges, I mostly play along to some of my favorite bands like Black Midi, King Gizzard and the Wizard Lizard,
                            Caseopia, and Rush and when my friends are in town we all will go and jam.

                        <h2>Sports</h2>
                        <p>Whether it be playing or watching, I've always been involved with sports. I've been playing soccer since kindergarten which colminated in me playing for a couple
                            club teams and for each school I went to. In high school I played for Ursuline's varsity soccer team and hope to get involved with a rec league after graduating.
                            In high school, a good friend of mine also introduced me to tennis, which I now play weekly. On the fan side, I'm a fan of all the Cleveland sports teams (yes even the Browns)
                            and am a fan of the Columbus Crew in the MLS, and Manchester United in the Premier League.

                        <h2>My Nerdy Hobbies</h2>
                        <p>Growing up, my first interaction with nerd culture was my utter obsession with all things Star Wars. To this day Episode III is my favorite Star Wars movie and I will die on this hill.
                            Over time, I also got into Lord of the Rings, Alien, and many other Sci-fi and Fantasy series. Along with this, my wallet has suffered getting into the card game Magic the Gathering and
                            miniature tabletop game Warhammer 40k. I also read when I have the time, and my favorite book right now is Lapvona by Ottessa Moshfegh.
